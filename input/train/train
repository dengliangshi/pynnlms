DAD THERE IS A WALL THERE AND YOU KNOW

SO I I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THIS UH YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL

HALF OF US DRIVE

BUT I THINK THERE IS THERE IS
LIKE WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT NOW LOOKING BACK I AM LIKE
EVEN THOUGH I DROVE
I KNOW THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE DRIVE
BECAUSE JUST IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED I MEAN MAYBE NOT SO MUCH ME LIKE I MADE A MISTAKE BUT IF SOMEONE WOULD
LIKE YOU KNOW MAKE A SUDDEN TURN OR A SUDDEN STOP AND I WOULD NOT HAVE THE
QUICK ENOUGH REFLEXES TO JUST REACT
LIKE PROPERLY AND AND YOU KNOW YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN

SO
YEAH I THINK UH
YEAH
HMMM

UH_HUH THAT IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY SOMETIMES YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU DRANK LIKE YOU ARE WITH FRIENDS AND LIKE
YOU CANNOT REALLY YOU KNOW REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU DRANK AND
LIKE EVERYONE'S TOLERANCE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOU ATE SOMETHING OR YOU KNOW

WELL EVERYONE HAS DONE IT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE ESPECIALLY DEPENDING UPON THE AREA THAT YOU LIVE IN
AND THERE IS NOTHING READILY AVAILABLE
FOR YOU
WELL YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE I GUESS WHENEVER YOU UH
WHENEVER YOU GO OUT YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW
YOUR LIMIT AND ALSO I MEAN LIKE ONE OR TWO BEERS IS I THINK IT IS FINE BUT

OF COURSE I SAY THAT NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ANOTHER
LANGUAGE FLUENTLY
I HAVE AH SOME GERMAN BUT
THAT IS THAT IS WAY BACK A LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

AMERICANS NOT BEING WILLING TO LEARN OTHER LANGUAGES

SPEAK ENGLISH BUT

WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION NOW
ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T THIS IS MY THIRD CALL AND I HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THE QUESTION YET
NO
THEY'RE JUST RECORDING FOR VOICE QUALITY
THAT'S ALL THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT
THEY COULD CARE LESS IF WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THEM OR
WHAT HAVE YOU
SO ARE YOU ON YOUR CELL PHONE NOW
I AM NOT
NOPE THIS WAS A CALL COMING IN TO ME
THEY'RE RECORDING
THE VOICE QUALITY BETWEEN A HOME PHONE AND A CELL PHONE
OR A P. C. S. PHONE I SHOULD USE THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY
SO
ARE YOU UP IN THE BETHLEHEM OFFICE OR
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT TOO
SO
WELL
LET'S SEE ONE THING WE COULD CHANGE
UH
I PROBABLY WOULD OF GOTTEN MARRIED SOONER
THAT WOULD BE ABOUT IT FOR ME
RIGHT
OH DEFINITELY COLLECTIBLES
IF WE ONLY KNEW NOW WHAT WE KNEW THEN OR
KNEW THEN YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I'M A UH TOY COLLECTOR MYSELF
YEAH I JUST WENT TO A TOY SHOW ON SUNDAY
OUT IN LEESPORT NEAR READING
AND UH
SOME OF THE STUFF I HAD WHEN I WAS LITTLE WAS KILLING ME
SOME OF THE ITEMS THERE WERE SELLING SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY OR MORE
AND I'M THINKING OH MY GOD AND IF I WANT IT BACK I GOT TO PAY THAT MUCH NOW
ALMOST IF HAD SMASHED IT WITH A HAMMER OR SOMETHING
SO
SPECIFICALLY I COLLECT LITTLE HOTWHEELS AND THE MATCHBOX CARS RIGHT NOW BUT
YEAH
WELL IT'S GOOD THOUGH AT LEAST IT'S AWAY
SO
BUT
YEAH I STILL HAVE THE CARS FROM WHEN I WAS LITTLE BUT YOU LOOK AT THEM AND IT LOOKS LIKE I DID HIT THEM WITH A HAMMER
THEY'RE NOT QUITE IN THE SHAPE THEY SHOULD BE
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING AND NOW YOU LOOK AT AND THE COLLECTORS ARE ACTUALLY BUYING THEM THAT NEVER LET THEIR KIDS PLAY WITH THEM
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS SO I'M BUYING THEM AND
I OPEN MOST OF THEM JUST FOR DISPLAY BUT
I STARTED OFF COLLECTING JUST THE JEEPS
CAUSE I OWN A JEEP
SO
AND THEN I GOT A LITTLE HAY WIRE FROM THERE
YEAH
YEAH
HAVE YOU PRICED OUT WHAT YOU OWN NOW
OH YEAH
YEAH
WOW
HUH
YOU SHOULD GO ON TO UH ONLINE AND CHECK OUT EBAY
NO I'VE ACTUALLY SOLD STUFF ON THERE AND I'VE BOUGHT STUFF ON THERE
AND I HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM YET AND THE ONE GUY HAD A PROBLEM WITH HE SHIPPED ME SOMETHING
THAT WAS TOTALLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SAID IT WAS
AND I EMAILED HIM AND HE SAID NO PROBLEM SEND IT BACK HE I'LL SEND YOU THE CHECK FIRST WITH THE MONEY TO SHIP IT BACK TO ME
BECAUSE IF THEY GET ONE BAD COMMENT
THEY'RE SCREWED
BASICALLY I MEAN THEY'RE SHOT
SO
IT'S NOT TOO BAD I MEAN I DON'T BUY TOO MUCH STUFF OFF OF IT BUT IT'S A GOOD WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR STUFF IS WORTH
LIKE IF YOU SEARCH ACTION FIGURES
AND YOU SPECIFICALLY PUT YOURS IT WILL DO A SEARCH OF EVERYTHING EVER SOLD ON EBAY
AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT THEY SOLD FOR
AND IT WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF JUST WHAT IT'S WORTH YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING OR SELL ANYTHING
YOU CAN JUST DO A SEARCH ON IT
AND YOU TYPE IN THE ITEM YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
YOU KNOW STAR WARS FIGURES OR WHATEVER
SO

I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT UH YOU CAN NOT
UH DETERMINE MINIMUM WAGE PER REGION
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WORK IN NEW YORK YOUR UM MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU LIVE UH
IN AMISH COUNTRY PENNSYLVANIA
OR THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE
ARE YOU FROM NEW YORK CITY
ARE YOU UH
WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU WORK FOR OMNIPOINT
OH DO YOU ALL RIGHT SO DO I
UM
BUT UH
OBVIOUSLY AS YOUR STANDARD EH OR THE STANDARDS OF LIVING INCREASE UH WITH UH
UH WITH UH INFLATION AND ALL THAT OBVIOUSLY NATURALLY EH MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE
HMMM NOT IF
NOT WITH A FAMILY ABSOLUTELY NOT
OH I AGREE NOT WITH A FAMILY OBVIOUSLY RENT OR RENT ALONE YOU FIVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT
YEAH FIVE TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR JUST DOES NOT CUT IT
OH I USE I STARTED I THINK AT FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO STILL
BUT THEN AGAIN UH THE COST OF LIVING WAS CHEAPER
I MEAN NEW CARS THESE DAYS ARE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU ARE LUCKY TO FIND A DECENT CAR UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT IS RIDICULOUS
NO
AND THEN MORTGAGES THESE DAYS I MEAN IF YOU FIND A HOME FOR UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT IS SOMEWHAT DECENT I MEAN IT IS IT IS
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS
NO
BUT EVEN IF YOU DO NOT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE YOU ARE STILL NOT MAKING ENOUGH I KNOW OURS
SO WE NOT WE ARE MAKING MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE BUT OUR SALARIES DON'T INCREASE WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE THEY SHOULD
YEAH ACTUALLY I DID I FIGURED I BETTER START DOING THIS BEFORE IT ENDS
FIFTEENTH IT ENDS THE FIFTEENTH
NO I I HAVE GOTTEN SEVERAL BUT I HAVE IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DURING WORK HOURS AND I I JUST COULD NOT ACCEPT THE PHONE CALLS SO I JUST UH DO NOT ANSWER THEM
WELL I PUT DOWN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY BUT EH I ALWAYS GET THEM IN THE MORNING I I SHOULD HAVE CHANGED MY TIMES WHILE AT NIGHT BUT
IT IS JUST UH
JUST I ALWAYS GET THEM DURING WORK HOURS
YEAH FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ARE ALL EMPLOYEES THERE IS NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT EMPLOYEES DOING IT
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT UH
SO HOW LONG ARE WE SUPPOSE DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG WE ARE SUPPOSE TO TALK ON THESE THINGS
OH I GUESS ABOUT FIVE MINUTES SO
I HAVE NO IDEA

DOWN SOUTH IT IS CHEAPER TO LIVE IN YOU KNOW IN
WOODS THAN IT IS YOU KNOW YEAH NEW YORK CITY AND STUFF SO IT DOES MAKE SENSE
THAT IT SHOULD IT SHOULD VARY FROM STATE TO STATE
NO
UH
BETHLEHEM
HMMM
OH YEAH
YEAH YEAH AND DEFINITELY
AND UM
THE THING THAT I SAID ABOUT UM IT IF IT SHOULD INCREASE
IN IN DIFFERENT STATES I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE
LIKE WE SAID BEFORE
I DO NOT EVEN THINK FIVE TWENTY FIVE IS ENOUGH
WELL NOT NOWADAYS
THAT IS RIGHT
BUT IT IS A LOT BETTER THEN WHEN I STARTED WHEN I STARTED THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS THREE TWENTY FIVE
YEAH
OH YEAH
THAT IS THAT IS ABOUT IT EVERYTHING GOES UP BUT YOUR WAGES
YOUR LUCKY IF YOU CAN FIND A DECENT ONE AT TWENTY THOUSAND
I KNOW IT IS I MEAN

THE HOUSE THAT I AM LIVING IN WHEN IT WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW IT WAS TWENTY ONE THOUSAND YOU CANT FIND A DECENT CAR FOR THAT
SO
OH YEAH THAT IS FOR SURE
BUT THAT KEEPS GOING UP AND WE JUST COME UP AS QUICK FOR SOME REASON
I DO NOT KNOW WHY

THEY DO I LIVED IN FLORIDA AND I DID SEE THEM WORKING
PICKING UP TRASH FROM THE ROADS AND AND I AM NOT EVEN SAYING THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A JOB OF GARBAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT JUST

JEFF'S CLASS
OH
YEAH
OH
JEFF SAID JEFF JUST SAID WHAT IS UP
OH

OH BE CAREFUL OF THE FLU IT IS GOING AROUND
YOU THINK SO
I THINK THAT THE PERSON SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED
CAUSE IT VIOLATES FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO PUNISH SOMEONE FOR DOING THAT
WHAT ARE YOU
WHAT ARE YOU RETARDED
IF YOU BURN THE
BURNING THE FLAG IS IS A SYMBOL FOR IS IS A ATTRIBUTED TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH IT IS A SYMBOL FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH
SO
OH GOD
YOU DO
WHAT
OH I KNOW
SO HOW MANY MORE MINUTES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS FIVE MORE MINUTES
WELL I CAN'T COME DOWN
I WISH I HAD A CIGARETTE UP HERE
AH
SO
YES I DID
ITS ITS
NO NO I HAVE TO ITS STEEPING
SO UM
THIS IS TOO WEIRD
SO GO AHEAD TELL ME WHAT YOU WHY DO YOU THINK A PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED MISTER
IS IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN FREEDOM OF SPEECH
FREEDOM
IT WOULD LET THE PEOPLE MAKE LET THE PEOPLE MAKE UP THE COUNTRY
FLAGS ARE SYMBOL FOR THE PEOPLE
SO DO YOU THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT BURN CROSSES ARE UH ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE PEOPLE THAT BURN FLAGS
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT BURNING A CROSS
THEY DON'T BURN CROSSES THEY LIGHT THEM UP
BURNING A FLAG IS NOT BAD
IT IS NOT
SHE'S KNOWS WHAT WHAT THE TOPIC IS
IS THAT WHAT
OH I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE ME
I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM GONNA HAVE TO TALK ON THIS PHONE TWO TIMES
BECAUSE
I AM NEXT
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD BE
WHAT I HOPE NOT COULD YOU IMAGINE IF I GOT YOU
THAT'S FUNNY
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE FOR BURNING THE FLAG
HUH
PEOPLE BURN THE FLAG THEY SHOULD BE BURNED THEY SHOULD BE KILLED
HOW
OH SO YOU ARE SAYING BURNED AT THE STAKE FOR BURNING A FLAG
WELL
THAT'S HEAVY DUTY
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SYMBOL IS WHEN YOU SIT AROUND AND BURN PEOPLE
AND SO ONE BAD SO TWO BAD THINGS RIGHT
SO UM
YOU FEEL THEY SHOULD BE BURNED
OH
SO HOW DO YOU VIEW SO YOU SAY THAT YOU VIEW BURNING A
GO AHEAD ASK ME
I DON'T THINK
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED I DON'T THINK THAT IT THAT IT IS REALLY THAT
YOU KNOW IMPORTANT AN ISSUE THAT IT IS ONLY A PIECE OF CLOTH THAT THEY ARE BURNING
THAT THEY COULD BURN FIVE THOUSAND FLAGS AND THERE WON'T BE DESTROYING ANY KIND OF HUMAN VALUE IT IS AN OPINION
SYMBOL AND UM
DADADADADADA YOU KNOW
YES
WHY
WELL
YOU ARE RETARDED
OH THAT IS SO WEIRD
RIGHT RIGHT
WOW
I HOPE WE COULD GET THAT PIECE OF FURNITURE UPSTAIRS
YOU THINK THAT IS HARD WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE COUCH
THE SECTIONAL THAT IS GOING TO BE A BITCH TO TAKE UP THERE
YOU KNOW SO
OH
FIVE
TOO MUCH
IT IS A SHAME WE CAN'T BE CALLING EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME
NO SMOKING UPSTAIRS
SO
DID YOU MAKE ALEXANDRA HER TEA
WHERE
DID YOU GIVE IT TO HER
BECAUSE THE FLAG REPRESENTS A VERY SYMBOLIC UM
IT IS UH ITS ITS VERY SYMBOLIC AND PATRIOTIC AND
NO ITS IT THAT WHAT IT REPRESENTS FREEDOM
FREEDOM
THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR OR OR HOW WE WERE LIKE ESTABLISHED AND
WITHOUT THAT FLAG
THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY WHAT AMERICA MEANS
YES
NO
BUT SO IS THE CROSS FOR THE CATHOLICS
THE FLAG IS THE EQUIVALENT TO THE CROSS
TO THE STAR OF DAVID
TO THE THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS
OH THEY SHOULD BE THAT'S THAT'S JUST AS BAD
THE SAME THING AS BURNING A A CARPET OR A FLAG
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
OH YOU KNOW
SHE KNOWS
NO THAT IT DOES
THAT IT THE CALLS
OH YOU KNEW
HOW DID I NOT KNOW
NO I THOUGHT YOU GOT TO CALL UP THERE
THAT'S WHY YOU COULD OF STAYED DOWN HERE I GOT THE FURNITURE FRENZY
NEXT TIME ALEXANDRA COMES OVER HERE SHE WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SLEEPING OUTSIDE
OH
OKAY
DO I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN
OH I CAN'T BEAR IT
I WAS WITH YOU ALL WEEKEND GET BACK TO WORK
LONG WEEK
BUT YET I AM A
I SCRUBBED THE KITCHEN CLEAN AND THE
DEATH
PUNISHMENT BY DEATH
THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED YES
IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY WOULD BURN THE FLAG BURN THEM TO DEATH
YES
LIKE JOAN OF ARK
YES I BELIEVE IN THAT RICH UM
I LOVE SYMBOLISM AND IT IS UH
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IT IS A DISRESPECT TO LIFE
DEATH IS JUST IS BAD
ANYTHING THAT THAT THAT DEALS WITH DESTRUCTION IS BAD
AND THAT IS IT
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS
YOU KNOW ME
DO YOU

NO WHY DON'T WHY DO YOU ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS GET SOME ANSWERS
I HAVE ASKED YOU THE THE SAME QUESTIONS YOU ASKED ME ASK YOURSELF AND I WILL ANSWER THEM
RIGHT
REALLY HOW DO THEY HOW ARE THEY LOOKING AT IT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
I THINK IT IS SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE IT FINANCIALLY ANYMORE
THAT IT JUST IT JUST MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO WAIT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND UH
YOU KNOW THE UH THE OLD SCHOOL THINKING THAT ALL RIGHT YOU GET MARRIED
AS A YOUNG PERSON TO BASICALLY FIT YOURSELF FINANCIALLY
YOU KNOW YOU WORK TOGETHER AND IT IS A LOT EASIER DOING IT THAT WAY THAN DOING IT ALONE
BUT YOU KNOW NOWADAYS YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO GET YOUR EDUCATION IN ORDER OR UM
EXACTLY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT COMPLICATES THE ISSUE TREMENDOUSLY
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH I HAVE ONE STEPDAUGHTER UH YEAH MY FIRST MARRIAGE MY WIFE DIVORCED AND UH THIS IS HER SECOND MARRIAGE
AND I KNOW
THE WAY YOU KNOW SHE KIND OF LOOKS AT THE WHOLE SITUATION
EH BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TO WHEN SHE MARRIED SHE MARRIED TOO YOUNG
AND YOU DO NOT MAKE THE WISEST CHOICES THEN YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREMATURE
RIGHT RIGHT YOU HAVE NOT FULLY EXPLORED WHO YOU ARE YET
YOU KNOW AND IT IS DIFFICULT IF THE OTHER PERSON THERE IS ONE THING SOME PEOPLE LUCK OUT THEY MARRY AT YOU KNOW TWELVE AND FOURTEEN ALL RIGHT
AND THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME TYPE OF PEOPLE SO THEY KIND OF GROW ON THE SAME PATH
SO YEAH OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO BE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT HAPPY MARRIAGE
BUT UM MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT LIKE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND UH
IN TODAY'S WORLD THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN FIND I MEAN YOU GOT THE INTERNET NOW
YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WITH EXACTLY YOUR INTERESTS
SO IT IT MAKES
TRYING TO STICK TOGETHER NOT SEEM RIGHT NOT SEEM THAT IMPORTANT
YOU KNOW IT IS LIKE WHAT IS THE POINT WHY SHOULD WE BE UNHAPPY WHEN YOU KNOW I WILL JUST MOVE ON RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT SELFSERVING RIGHT
RIGHT AT WHAT EXPENSE
AT
AT AH WHAT EXPENSE AND AH YOU KNOW IT TO ME A LOT OF THAT ALSO IS UH
IT KIND OF BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS THAT MAYBE PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE EARLY IN THE CENTURY
YOU KNOW WOMEN NOW
YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET YOUR EDUCATION AND ACTUALLY BE TREATED FAIR
ON A LOT OF LEVELS I MEAN BEFORE
THE DISCRIMINATION WAS THERE GENDER DISCRIMINATION WHERE
YOU WANTED TO GO OUT AND GET A JOB YOU HAD CERTAIN ROLES THAT YOU WERE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE TEACHER
TEACHER RIGHT AND UH FINE IF YOU GO IN THOSE ROLES YOU WERE FINE
BUT UM IF YOU DID NOT YOU HAD LIMITED OPTIONS
SO YOU WERE KIND OF STUCK AND YOU FELT YOU WERE STUCK AND UH
YOU KNOW YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE WELL EVERYONE ELSE STAYS MARRIED
AH THERE WERE NO ROLE MODELS
TO BE DIVORCED NO NO
RIGHT
BILL BIXBY
OH YEAH
I REMEMBER THAT

YES OR OR YOU KNOW THEY COUCHED IT AS WIDOW
SHE WAS A WIDOW OR HE WAS A WIDOWER SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT SITUATION YOU WERE

OH IT IS CRAZY NOW I KNOW IT IS SO CRAZY
I I THINK THAT
EH UH I I STILL THINK OF IT IN AN OLD FASHIONED WAY AS SURPRISING AS THAT MAY BE
BUT UM ALL OF OUR KIDS VIEW IT DIFFERENTLY A LOT DIFFERENTLY THAN THAN WHEN I WAS A KID
WELL THEY LOOK AT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY ARE GOING TO DO MUCH LATER IN LIFE IT IS NOT AS ROMANTICISED
YOU KNOW IT IS NOT LIKE A PRINCE CHARMING IS GOING TO COME ALONG AND UH AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU KNOW BOTH BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS IN OUR FAMILY YOU KNOW FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT GETTING A JOB GOING TO COLLEGE UM THOSE KIND OF THINGS
OH YEAH
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT

RIGHT AND GET YOUR CAREER STARTED BEFORE YOU HAVE BABIES
RIGHT
YEAH I KNOW AND THAT IS THAT IS REALLY YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO AS FAR ESPECIALLY MY DAUGHTER FEELS ABOUT GETTING MARRIED
THAT YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT TO GET HER CAREER STARTED UP AND GOING BECAUSE SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FAMILY BUT
BUT HER I GUESS SHE FIGURES PRETTY MUCH ALTHOUGH I AM SURE THAT STILL AT HER AGE SHE WOULD LIKE
UM TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
BUT I THINK SHE KNOWS THAT SHE IS YOU KNOW THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAPPEN AT ALL OR THAT SHE WILL DEFINITELY BE
YOU KNOW WORKING YOU KNOW FULLTIME MOST OF HER LIFE

WHEN THERE IS HAPPINESS TO BE FOUND RIGHT BUT THAT THAT IS KIND OF IT IS SAD THAT THAT IT THAT
THAT IS KIND OF
VERY SELFISH WHICH I THINK IS A LOT DIFFERENT THEN WHAT IT USED TO BE I I DO NOT
THINK THAT THAT IS WRONG OR RIGHT BUT PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE SELFSERVING THAN THEY USED
TO BE SELFISH IS PROBABLY THE WRONG WORD UM EVERYBODY BELIEVES THAT THEY DESERVE HAPPINESS AND THEY DO
BUT I THINK WE FIND
YOU KNOW HAPPINESS A LOT DIFFERENTLY THAN THAN LIKE OR PARENTS DID
YEAH AND AT WHAT EXPENSE RIGHT RIGHT
THAT IS RIGHT
OH SURE
RIGHT

BECAUSE
I DO NOT LIKE WHEN I GO TO A RESTAURANT

IS TERRIBLE

THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT A LOT OF PEOPLE
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TRIES TO SAY THAT
FOR YEARS HOW LONG DID THEY SAY THAT

FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
FROM EXTRA MONEY ON TOP

OF THE PEOPLE I MEAN LIKE I KNOW MYSELF I AM MORE OF A SOCIAL SMOKER
SO UM LIKE I I I CAN GO THE WHOLE ENTIRE DAY AND NOT SMOKE ONE CIGARETTE AND THEN
AS SOON AS I GET A BEER IN MY HAND I HAVE TO SMOKE AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE THAT WHERE IT IS MORE OF A SOCIAL SETTING

DUE TO I DO NOT KNOW I FIGURE IF YOU DO NOT
LIKE ME I DO NOT LIKE THE WAY I SMELL WHEN I COME HOME EITHER BUT I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT AND I I ACTUALLY I SEE BOTH SIDES OF IT YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE
ME LIKE I I KIND OF AM SYMPATHETIC TO BOTH SIDES BECAUSE IF I AM EATING
I CAN NOT HAVE SMOKE AROUND ME WHEN I AM EATING IT KIND OF MAKES ME NAUSEOUS BUT THEN AGAIN
THERE I SIT SMOKING A CIGARETTE WHILE I AM DRINKING SO I MEAN I AM A VERY UM
PATHETIC SMOKER THAT IS WHAT I CALL MYSELF A PATHETIC SMOKER

WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE YOU SAID BARS OR RESTAURANT
MORE WITH BARS IF IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT SETTING
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PACKAGE IN GENERAL
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE WHEREAS A RESTAURANT
LIKE YOU KNOW YOU ARE GONNA TAKE KIDS THERE AND AND YOU KNOW FAMILY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NON SMOKERS
I AM NOT SAYING THAT EVERYBODY THAT GOES TO A BAR IS A SMOKER BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN MAKE THAT CONSCIOUS CHOICE
IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THAT PART OF THE BAR SCENE THEN YOU KNOW DO NOT GO TO THE BAR
YOU KNOW UM AND I THINK BUT THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE LIKE SUCH AS AEROPLANES I DO NOT THINK YOU SHOULD BE SMOKING ON AEROPLANES BECAUSE
FIRST OF ALL
RIGHT I MEAN IT IS SUCH A SMALL
IT IS A VERY SMALL
RIGHT
AND IT IS SUCH A SMALL
GO AHEAD

DO YOU WORK FOR OMNIPOINT ALSO
OH I HAVE TALKED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR OMNIPOINT ON IN THIS PROGRAM
YES I HAVE YEAH
IN FACT THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE GENERALLY ASK ME DO YOU WORK FOR OMNIPOINT THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY SAY TO ME
NO I DO NOT JUST MY HUSBAND THAT IS HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE PROGRAM HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT IT
OH
THE TOPIC IS ABOUT UH WHETHER YOU THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES
AND UH ARE THEY UH
DOING WELL EVIDENTLY SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT THAT WAS A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO I FORGOT UM
WELL I LIVE IN A VERY LITTLE VERY SMALL TOWN BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PUBLIC LIBRARY IT IS IT IS QUITE A SMALL LIBRARY BUT IT IS WELL USED
AND IT HAS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN KEPT UP
YES I HAVE TWO GROWN CHILDREN THEY ARE BOTH IN NEW YORK CELEBRATING THEY LIVE IN NEW YORK AND THEY ARE HAVING A PARTY IN THEIR APARTMENT
I JUST TALKED WITH THEM A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO
YES THEY ARE HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME
THEY DO HAVE A PROGRAM FOR READING TO YOUNG CHILDREN AT OUR LOCAL LIBRARY
IT IS IT IS NOT VERY WELL FUNDED THEY HAVE TO UH YOU KNOW PUT ON PROGRAMS TO TRY AND FUND IT AND
THEY THEY HAVE A A DIFFICULT TIME KEEPING MONEY COMING IN BUT I I DO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT
IT DOES SUCH A LOT OF A LOT OF GOOD PROGRAMS FOR YOUNGSTERS
YES RIGHT THEY DO
HMMM
WELL OUR LITTLE TOWN IS KIND OF PROUD OF OUR LIBRARY BECAUSE IT IT THERE ARE IT IS WHOLE AREA OF SMALL TOWNS
AND WE ARE THE ONLY SMALL TOWN THAT HAS HAD ONE FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS I SUPPOSE AND HAS KEPT IT GOING CONTINUOUSLY
MOST OF THE OTHER TOWNS YOU HAVE TO GO TO UH ONE OF THE SMALL CITIES
WE HAVE A LOT OF SMALL TOWNS IN OUR AREA I AM CALLING OR I AM TALKING TO YOU FROM UP AROUND THE POCONOS IN PENNSYLVANIA THAT AREA
YES I AM
ALL MY LIFE I WAS BORN HERE RAISED HERE YEAH
OH WOW
NO
I I UNFORTUNATELY I AM I AM JUST UH HANGING OUT WITH THE CAT THIS EVENING
HERE WE GO
AND HAPPY NEW YEAR
THIS IS IT AND THE POWER DID NOT GO OUT
OH PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT I HAVE NOT BEEN EXPECTING IT AT ALL I DID NOT THINK MUCH OF ANYTHING WOULD BE HAPPENING
NO I I WAS NOT WORRIED
NO
NOTHING AT ALL
OH I UM I HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND I DID UM
SOMETHING TOTALLY LIKE DIFFERENT LIKE I WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE WORK FORCE RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL AND UM JUST NOW I AM STARTING TO GO BACK AND I AM DOING IT ONLINE
AND UM I AM FINDING IT EXTREMELY EXTREMELY CONVENIENT
SO UH YEAH I MEAN LIKE I WOULD ALMOST ADVISE UH
BASICALLY LET THE KID DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO LIKE YOU KNOW IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO JUMP RIGHT INTO COLLEGE LET THEM INTO THE WORK FORCE
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES NOW YOU CAN GET TUITION ASSISTANCE WHICH IS VERY COOL AND HAVE UH A COMPANY PAY FOR THE TUITION OR AT LEAST A GOOD PART OF IT
UM AND THE ONLINE THING IS JUST SO CONVENIENT MAN
YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN LIKE IF YOUR EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND YOUR PARENTS LIKE KIND OF LIKE THROW YOU INTO COLLEGE WHETHER YOU KNOW BE WHATEVER IT IS ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YES SOMETIMES NO
I DEFINITELY I KNOW I DEFINITELY WAS NOT READY FOR IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH YOU ARE YOU ARE VERY LUCKY THAT YOU MADE IT OUT DID YOU GO RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL OR
I KNOW THE FEELING
THAT IS VERY GOOD I MEAN THAT IS ONE THING THAT I DO LOOK BACK AT AND I REGRET THOUGH I MEAN LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE
AROUND LIKE THE SAME PACE AS ME ALREADY HAVE A DEGREE AND I DO NOT
AND I KIND OF WISH I DID
BUT THE ONLINE IS INTERESTING I MEAN IT IS WHAT IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS UM
YOU KNOW I AM A SINGLE PROVIDER FOR MY FAMILY AND UH
YOU KNOW I WORK A LOT OF HOURS SO UH
YOU KNOW THE CONVENIENCE OF BEING ABLE TO LIKE ATTEND CLASSES AT LIKE MIDNIGHT OR THREE O. CLOCK IN THE MORNING IS EXCELLENT
ALMOST
ALMOST WHAT HAPPENS IS LIKE YOU I GO TO UM THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX
AND UM
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LOG ON
AND UH YOUR PROFESSOR WILL BASICALLY SEND YOU
ALL THE READING ASSIGNMENTS AND HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AND UH IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER
YOU ORDER LIKE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HUGE BOOKS IT IS IT IS DEFINITELY A LOT OF WORK IT IS VERY FAST PACED
IT IS VERY AGGRESSIVE
UM
BUT YOU KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO READ LIKE A COUPLE CHAPTERS IT IS A SEVEN DAY A WEEK THING
EACH SEMESTER IS FIVE WEEKS LONG AND THAT IS IT THERE IS NO WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY TAKE MORE THAN ONE CLASS A SHOT
UM YOU DOWNLOAD ALL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS
UM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LIKE ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE READING
AND UH THEN THE PROFESSOR WILL THROW OUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT LIKE THE BUSINESS WORLD AND STUFF
AND UM YOU BASICALLY REPLY TO THE QUESTION
AND THEN THE OTHER CLASSMATES WILL ALSO REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS AND KIND OF LIKE BRING UP A FEW INTERESTING TOPICS HERE AND THERE
THEY MAY ASK YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RESPONSE AND THEN YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH
UM AND YOU GET THE ANSWERS BASICALLY LIKE YOU KNOW YOU WILL SUBMIT ALL YOUR ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS
AND THEN MAYBE LATER ON OR THE NEXT DAY YOU WILL LOG BACK IN AND YOU WILL GET RESPONSES TO YOUR QUESTIONS
FIRE FIRE OFF MORE
COMMENTS HERE AND THERE
IT GOES VERY QUICK UM
IT IS IT IS A LOT OF FUN THOUGH I MEAN WHAT IS REALLY COOL ABOUT IT IS
YOU ARE ATTENDING CLASS WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SOMETIMES ALL OVER THE WORLD
UM
YOU GET LIKE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN LIKE TAKE TO THE OFFICE THE VERY NEXT DAY
AND UH THE OTHER REALLY COOL THING ABOUT IS THE NETWORKING POSSIBILITIES LIKE I MET UM
SOME GOOD PEOPLE FROM H. P. THROUGH THAT
UM
THE OTHER THING IS IS UM
MY FRIEND ALSO IS AH DOING IT ONLINE AND UH SHE GOT CHOSEN FOR A UH
A FOCUS GROUP WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SENT HER DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS
FOR A WEEKEND TOTALLY PAID
UM JUST TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE AND GIVE HER THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS ABOUT IT
YEAH
WELL I THINK THE CREDIBILITY WAS A BIG ISSUE TOO I MEAN LIKE
HOW CREDIBLE ARE THESE ARE THESE COLLEGES THAT ARE OFFERING ONLINE
YOU KNOW DEGREES IS IT REALLY WORTH SOMETHING
AND UM YOU KNOW THE REASON THAT I FOCUSED IN ON THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX WAS BECAUSE IT WAS A BIG NAME
UM THE ONLY DRAWBACK THERE ALSO IS IT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IT IS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED BUCKS A CLASS
AND UM
RIGHT NOW THE COMPANY I AM WITH UH EH THEY DO NOT OFFER TUITION ASSISTANCE SO
OH YEAH THINK ABOUT IT IT IS A LOT OF PRESSURE TOO FOR A KID I MEAN
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS IT WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE BECAUSE FOR AWHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE AND
YES I DID
YES I DID
UH_HUH
UH_HUH
UH HA
WOW THAT IS INTERESTING
HMMM
RIGHT
I BELIEVE IT AND I ACTUALLY YOU LET THE KID DO WHAT THEY WANT TAKES THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH
UH
HMMM
I CAN NOT TELL YOU
HMMM I CAN I CAN NOT TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH WHO WERE NOT READY TO BE THERE
UH THEY WERE NOT
YEAH I DID I DID I ACTUALLY TOOK SOME TIME OFF IN THE MIDDLE UH
BECAUSE I I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TOTALLY READY TO BE THERE
RIGHT AWAY
SO
YEP BUT NOW IT HAS IT HAS WORKED OUT I MET MY WIFE AT COLLEGE AND LIFE IS GOOD
HMMM
HMMM
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS EH HOW I FELT DURING THOSE THAT TIME OFF THAT I TOOK PEOPLE WERE GRADUATING AND
THEY WERE IN MY CLASS BUT
NOW I AM NOT WITH THEM ANYMORE
BUT
HMMM
HMMM
HOW DOES THAT WORK IS IT IS IT SORT OF A CHAT TYPE THING OR IS IT A HERE IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT AND DO IT
UH_HUH
HMMM
UH_HUH
YEAH
HMMM
HMMM
OH YEAH
HMMM
FASCINATING
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT IS A REALLY WORTHWHILE
THING TO DO AND I AM GLAD IT HAS PROGRESSED THIS FAR BECAUSE I I REMEMBER HEARING EARLY ON IN THE ONLINE UH EDUCATION
WORLD A FEW YEARS AGO THAT IT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT BUT SO
HMMM
RIGHT
HMMM
RIGHT
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW YOU BROUGHT SOME VERY VALID POINTS ABOUT TRYING TO CHOOSE COLLEGE HOW TO DO IT
WHAT TO DO UM
TRYING IF IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO TO A TRADITIONAL COLLEGE YOU NEED TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
WHAT TRACK YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE BECAUSE IF YOU SPIN YOUR WHEELS TOO MUCH YOU ARE JUST YOU ARE YOU ARE GONE YOU ARE WASTING YOUR PARENTS MONEY AND
AND THAT IS THAT
HMMM ABSOLUTELY
UM I THINK THAT IF THE
THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IF THINGS WERE QUOTE LEVEL ON THE PLAYING FIELD BEFORE THEN
OKAY THEY WOULD NOT NEED THAT AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE GET TO CERTAIN UM
POSITIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER OR THEIR RACE OR THEIR ETHNICITY
OR AND IF SOMEONE ELSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THAT UH THAT
GOING FOR THEM AND THEY MAY NOT GET THE DEAL SO THEN NOW WHO WHAT DO YOU DO DO YOU SPITE ONE AND
HELP THE OTHER ONE SOMEBODY GAIN SOMEBODY LOSES
I THINK OVER AND ALL IT HAS TO BE UH UH SOMETHING
YEAH
WELL
WELL I KNOW UM MY DAUGHTER SHE IS A MANAGER OF A JOB SHE IS THE MANAGER
AND UM IT IS LIKE UM AND HER POSITION IS THAT
HER UH FOR HER COLLEAGUES TO SEE HER HER BOSS IS ALSO A FEMALE
AND UH THEY TELL ME WHAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO JUST BY BEING A JOB
DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER WHETHER THEY ARE BLACK OR WHITE OR BLUE OR GREEN
IT IS JUST THEY ARE A WOMAN AND THEY HAVE A JOB THAT IS MAYBE TRADITIONALLY WOULD BE HELD BY A MALE
SO THEY HAVE TO
YEAH AND THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS TOO SO
I THINK BASICALLY IF A PERSON IS QUALIFIED THEY SHOULD GET THE JOB
BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN DISAPPROPRIATE OVER THE YEARS
I MEAN MAKE IT SO ACTIVE OKAY ME ME PERSONALLY UM
I GOT MY JOB THAT I AM WORKING AT NOW BECAUSE OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS ACT
AND THAT WAS AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OF MY AGE
I WENT TO GET A JOB AND UM BECAUSE BECAUSE I WAS QUALIFIED IN SPITE OF MY AGE AND MY YEARS
I GOT THE JOB
SO I FELT GOOD ABOUT THAT NOW THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN A JOB
BECAUSE THEY SAID WELL THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT LISTS OF EVERYTHING AND THEY HAVE QUOTE THE BLACK LIST OR THE WHITE LIST
SO I THINK THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS I THINK IT IS IT IT IS IT IS SET OUT
TO BE POSITIVE AND AS SAY AFFIRMATIVE
BUT ALSO IT IS HARD TO MAKE ONE PERSON SATISFIED
AND NOT ANOTHER PERSON
GEOLOGICAL YEAH YES YOU ARE RIGHT ECONOMICS SEE PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE THAT
PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE POOR ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET I GUESS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY SAY BECAUSE UM THEY SAY
WELL IT IS ALL ALL BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN THE CITY BUT WHAT ABOUT IN RURAL APPALACHIA OR VIRGINIA
YEAH AND YEAH ABOUT RURAL APPALACHIA THE COAL MINERS THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE REALLY REALLY POOR
UH I BET PEOPLE HAVE NOT SEEN POOR UNTIL THEY HAVE TO LIVE THAT TYPE OF LIFESTYLE SO FOR
YEAH MY NIECE MY NIECE SHE IS A NURSE ALSO
YEAH SO YEAH I KNOW
BUT I
BUT I STILL YEAH BUT I STILL THINK IF YOU ARE QUALIFIED YOUR GENDER SHOULD YOUR GENDER SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
AND YOUR SKIN COLOUR YOUR ETHNICITY EVEN YOUR SEXUAL PREFERENCE
SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT I MEAN IF A PERSON IF A PERSON IS IS IS GREEN WITH A WITH A RED STRIPE DOWN THEIR BACK AND UH
TO EIGHTEEN PURPLE PINK FINGERNAILS IF THEY CAN DO THE JOB RESPECT PEOPLE
AND UH TREAT PEOPLE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS THEN THERE IS NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN SAY
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HMMM
HMMM
WELL IT IS FUNNY YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE
LATELY I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO IT BECAUSE UM
SOME OF THE BANDS I LIKE TO SEE
PART OF THEIR ACT NOW HAS BECOME BURNING THE FLAG
YEAH AND ACTUALLY I AM A
HUGE WRESTLING FAN
AND THERE IS A LOT OF
FLAG BURNING GOING ON IN WRESTLING
YEAH
YEAH
YOU COULD TELL IT IS IN THERE JUST FOR SHOCK VALUE
RATINGS
YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY BURN A
FLAG AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ARE IN THE NEWSPAPER
HUH
YEAH
TRUE IF YOU IF YOU USE IT AS
KINDLING TO BURN DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE
THEN YOU GOT A PROBLEM
HMMM
THAT IS A GOOD POINT
THAT IS A GOOD POINT YEAH
WELL YOU CAN NOT BE BIASED I MEAN IF
YOU GOING TO BAN IT FOR THE AMERICAN FLAG YOU GOT TO
BAN IT FOR EVERY FLAG
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU ARE YOU KNOW YOU ARE
INFRINGING ON SOMEBODY'S FREEDOM OF SPEECH
YEAH
HMMM
TELL THAT TO A VETERAN THOUGH THAT LOST HIS
BEST FRIEND DEFENDING THE FLAG THOUGH
AND THEN SEE YOU KNOW THAT IS THE FLIP SIDE
AND HERE IS THE GUY WHO WAS OUT THERE IN THE
JUNGLE KNEE DEEP IN RICE PATTIES
YOU KNOW HAVING HIS BEST FRIEND SHOT
OVER A FLAG
AND THEN YOU YOU SOME PUNK IS GOING TO
GO AND AND BURN IT
IN FRONT OF HIM YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS A
HE HE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION
EXACTLY
AND UH
SO
NO
HMMM

UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I SET THIS UP
WITH THE UH WITH OMNIPOINT OR WHOEVER IT IS
I ASKED THEM IF WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE SUBJECT AND THEY WERE LIKE
NO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST KEEP TALKING

HIGH SCHOOLS THAT COST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR WHATEVER

SOMEBODY SENDS ME RECENTLY UM
A CHRISTMAS GAME
LIKE THAT WAS DESIGNED BY SOME LIKE COMPUTER SOFTWARE COMPANY
UM THEY SENT IT TO ME BY EMAIL
AND I YOU KNOW SAVED IT TO MY HARD DRIVE
BECAUSE I HAVE KIDS I I WORK IN A COUNSELLING CENTRE
SO I HAVE KIDS SOMETIMES COME VISIT ME
JUST HANGING OUT WAITING FOR THEIR PARENTS OR SOMETHING
SO I FIGURED I WOULD SAVE IT TO OCCUPY THEM
YEAH WELL IT WORKS
I JUST HAD SOMEBODY IN HERE USING IT
IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF CUTE IT WAS ELF BOWLING
THERE WAS A SANTA CLAUSE
AND THERE WERE LIKE ELVES TEN ELVES AT THE END OF THE SCREEN
AND AND YOU WOULD JUST PRESS THE SPACE BARS
SO IT WAS REALLY SIMPLE FOR KIDS TO PLAY WITH
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS RIGHT YEAH
SOLITAIRE WAS A BIG ONE

YEAH THEIR IS OTHER THINGS THAT I WOULD PREFER TO DO ON THE COMPUTER
OR LIKE I WILL GO ON THE INTERNET AND FIND YOU KNOW INTERESTING WASTE TIME
I WILL WASTE TIME ON THE COMPUTER JUST NOT WITH GAMES
UH_HUH
OH YEAH A ONE OF MY ONE A MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR
YOU KNOW DENIES THAT THE INTERNET IS OF ANY USE AT ALL
BUT UM SHE NEEDED A A ONE OF HER HER SONS UM
WAS BUYING A HOME AND ALWAYS ADMIRED ONE OF HER LAMPS
AND IT WAS LIKE AN ANTIQUE LAMP
AND SO SHE WANTED EH AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THE MANUFACTURER
LIKE THE THE NUMBER THAT YOU CALL THE MANUFACTURER OR ANYTHING
AND SO SHE SHE COMES TO ME AND SHE SAYS DO NOT TELL MY SON
AND CAN YOU SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THE NAME OF THE
COMPANY YOU KNOW THE COMPANY AND SEE IF THEY ARE STILL MAKING THESE THINGS
SO I SAID I WOULD TRY AND I DID IT WAS LIKE ONLY THREE CLICKS
AND I FOUND IT AND I GAVE IT TO HER
SO SHE NOW NOW SHE NOW SHE CAN GET HER SON A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
WELL RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT LIKE THE INFORMATION THAT IS ON THE INTERNET
YOU CAN MOSTLY GET THROUGH OTHER LIKE THE ESSENTIAL STUFF
THE STUFF THAT I GO ON THE INTERNET TO FIND
AND I CAN USUALLY FIND IN OTHER WAYS
BUT IT JUST UM LIKE YOU KNOW CALLING SOMEBODY
BUT IT JUST SOMETIMES SEEMS EASIER TO DO IT MYSELF
THEN TO USE THE UH YOU KNOW
BY THE INTERNET THAN TO THAN TO USE THE PHONE
BUT IT DOES REQUIRE LIKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FACILITY WITH IT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS
THE THE WAY THAT SOMEBODY SETS UP THEIR HOME SIGHT
THEY WILL THEY USE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE USED
LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY DO IT
LIKE THEY WILL ORGANISE INTO CERTAIN
LIKE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A A TABLE OF CONTENTS IN A BOOK
ONCE YOUR FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY A TABLE OF CONTENTS WORKS
LIKE THE INTRODUCTION COMES FIRST
THEN YOU KNOW THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE APPENDIXES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
THAT IS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A BOOK
BUT ON THE INTERNET THERE IS THE SAME THING
BUT EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT CALLED THINGS LIKE THAT THEY ARE CALLED LIKE
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS OR HOW TO CONTACT US
SO THAT ONCE YOU HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF THEM
YOU GET THEN TO KNOW THE EASIEST WAY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
OR EVEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO THAT PARTICULAR SIGHT BEFORE
UM
EH I THINK IT IS THE THING TO KNOW IS
YOU CAN NOT REALLY DO ANY DAMAGE TO IT
SO SO YOU JUST HAVE TO SORT OF LIKE BE BOLD
THEN GO AROUND AND PLAY WITH IT
BUT HMMM
UH_HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK IT IS WORTH WHILE TO GET THE INTERNET
BUT NOT MOSTLY NOT TO GET INFORMATION
UM BECAUSE LIKE I SAID YOU CAN GET IT FROM OTHER PLACES
BUT MORE SO THAT YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE
LIKE I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY
IF MY MOM GOT IT
BECAUSE SO THAT I COULD UH I COULD SEND HER EMAIL RATHER THAN CALLING HER FREQUENTLY
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND YOU CAN SEND STUFF
HMMM YOU KNOW LIKE PICTURES AND STUFF AND AND
PARTICULARLY WITH LIKE LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP
HMMM
OH THAT IS THAT IS A GOOD IDEA
OH HOW CUTE
IT SOUNDS GREAT
I AM SURE KIDS WOULD REALLY ENJOY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS UH
GOING TO BE SEVENTEEN TOMORROW
AND UH SHE NEVER REALLY
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SHE USED TO PLAY GAMES ON THE COMPUTER UM
SHE STILL OCCASIONALLY WILL PLAY UM LIKE
CARD GAMES LIKE SOLITAIRE AND UM STUFF LIKE THAT

UM YOU KNOW IF HE IF HE IS UM HOME AND DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
HE WILL GO UP ON THE COMPUTER AND
HE HAS A COUPLE OF GAMES INSTALLED ON THE COMPUTER

NO
HMMM
OH THAT IS TERRIFIC
SEE IT DOES COME IN
WE DO NOT HAVE THE INTERNET HOOKED UP
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT DOING IT UM
YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING IT AND YOU
I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW HOW MUCH OF VALUE IT IS TO
YOU KNOW INVEST IN IT UM LIKE I SAID I KNOW MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN AFTER US TO DO IT
HMMM
HMMM
YES
I SEE NOW DID YOU DID YOU NEED ANY SPECIAL TRAINING
TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE INTERNET
OR WAS IT SOMETHING THAT JUST IS SELF EXPLANATORY WHEN YOU GO INTO IT
HMMM
I KNOW THAT WAS THE THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM WHEN WE FIRST GOT OUR PERSONAL COMPUTER
UM WE WERE ALWAYS AFRAID THAT WE WERE GOING TO HIT THE WRONG BUTTON AND
SOMEHOW MESS EVERYTHING UP YOU KNOW
OH I KNOW MY HUSBAND WAS LIKE THAT WHEN HE FIRST STARTED
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TERRIFIED OF IT YOU KNOW
NOW HE IS NOT BECAUSE HE HE IS UM
AT WORK HE HAD TO UM
HIS UH HE WORKS AS A RECEIVER IN A SUPER MARKET
AND THEY WENT UNDER A COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR THE RECEIVING
UH GOING BACK A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND
WORKING WITH IT THROUGH WORK
UM HE BECAME REAL FAMILIAR WITH IT
AND HE REALISED THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY CAN NOT MESS IT UP TOO BADLY SO
SO THEN HE DECIDED TO YOU KNOW DO A LITTLE MORE WITH OUR COMPUTER AT HOME
AND UH HE UH HE REALLY ENJOYS IT
HMMM
UH_HUH
OH REALLY
OH REALLY OKAY
RIGHT RIGHT WELL PLEASE

IN SCHOOL AND I AM ALSO AN EMPLOYEE
DO YOU WORK FOR OMNIPOINT
UH_HUH
OH REALLY OKAY
THAT WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE WHO WERE IN THE STUDY
I THINK
I I THINK THIS IS MY
SIXTH CALL THAT I HAVE MADE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY YET
UM AND UH
I I THINK EVERYONE I SPOKE TO EXCEPT ONE PERSON WORKS FOR OMNIPOINT
SO I GUESS THAT IS THAT IS A PRETTY BIG NUMBER
UH_HUH
UH_HUH
UH_HUH
RIGHT RIGHT WHAT DO YOU THINK
HMMM
RIGHT EXACTLY
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH I I GUESS I FEEL THE SAME WAY YOU DO I MEAN AH I
YOU KNOW I I WOULD
NEVER I CAN NOT EVER IMAGINE MYSELF GETTING GETTING ANGRY OR
YOU KNOW UPSET ENOUGH TO WANT TO BURN THE AMERICAN FLAG
BUT UM ON THE OTHER HAND IF SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO IT
YOU KNOW THAT IS FINE I I I DO NOT WANT TO IT
YEAH EXACTLY I MEAN
TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH AND I GUESS IN A DEMOCRACY YOU KNOW IF YOU DO NOT UM
IF YOU DO NOT LET PEOPLE DO THINGS THAT YOU THINK ARE SILLY LIKE BURN THE FLAG THEN
THEN MAYBE SOME FREEDOM OF YOURS MIGHT NOT BE ALLOWED EITHER
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH I ACTUALLY GREW UP IN SOUTH PHILADELPHIA AND I LIVE OUT IN THE SUBURBS NOW
AND I
UH
UH LET US SEE STARTED AT COLLEGE AT AT PENN
AND UM
SOMETIME AFTER THAT MY PARENTS DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF SOUTH PHILLY AND SO THEY MOVED OUT AND
THEN I MOVED OUT TOO
IT IS
UM IT IS NOT THAT FAR ALTHOUGH IT IS KIND OF SLOW BECAUSE THE TROLLEYS THAT WE TAKE ARE YOU KNOW THEY RUN LIKE EVERY HALF HOUR
SO IF YOU DO NOT
YEAH IT IS KIND OF IF YOU DO NOT CATCH IT JUST RIGHT THEN YOU GET TO WAIT FOR YOU KNOW UP TO HALF HOUR UNTIL THE NEXT ONE COMES
SO ARE YOU LIVING UP
I AM SORRY GO AHEAD
OH REALLY

UH_HUH
OKAY
IT MUST BE REALLY NICE TO LIVE IN THE POCONOS DO YOU LIKE IT

UH_HUH
RIGHT RIGHT
WHAT AM I STUDYING
UM I ACTUALLY STUDY UH TWO THINGS UM LINGUISTICS AND COMPUTING
YEAH
SORT OF I I YEAH
I MEAN WHAT I DO IS
IS UH NOT LIKE WHAT THE STUDY IS ABOUT I GUESS BUT WHAT I STUDY IS UM PRONUNCIATION
AND HOW PRONUNCIATIONS ARE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO WHAT GROUP THEY BELONG TO
YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE MALE OR FEMALE OR YOU KNOW WHAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY YOU COME FROM THAT KIND OF STUFF
SO IT IS NOT IT IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE STUDY IS ABOUT BUT IT SEEMED INTERESTING ENOUGH ANYWAY
UH_HUH
REALLY
SO PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THAT YOU ARE THEY DO NOT KNOW YOU ARE FROM NEW YORK
YEAH BUT JUST
UM OKAY EM YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS BY SENDING ONE

THAT I GUESS YOU WOULD ADVISE YOUR CHILD EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU YOU ARE GOING
WELL I THAT IS THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD DO UM HOWEVER IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC COLLEGES
OR YOU KNOW UH OR CERTAIN YOU KNOW FIELDS OF STUDY OR PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW COLLEGES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY GOOD YOU KNOW FOR ENGINEERING OR FOR BUSINESS
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO JUST APPLY IT TO THOSE ALSO YOU KNOW YOU YOU CANNOT
THAT
THAT IS TRUE YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT UM
MY SON HAPPENED TO UM WANT TO BE AN AN ENGINEERING MAJOR
AND HE STARTED OUT IN CORNELL AND RIGHT AND THEN HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO GO TO VIRGINIA
NO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA
AND THE ONLY WAY SOMEBODY FROM NEW JERSEY CAN GET INTO THAT COLLEGE IS BY TRANSFERRING
YOU KNOW AND HE WAS JUST VERY LUCKY TO TRANSFER BECAUSE THEY DO NOT I THINK THEY ACCEPT MAYBE A HUNDRED PEOPLE A YEAR
YOU KNOW IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IN FROM OUT OF STATE
SO YOU KNOW
IF YOU ARE STUCK WITH A MAJOR AND HE ACTUALLY CHANGED HE SWITCHED FROM ENGINEERING TO ECONOMICS WHILE WHILE WHILE HE WAS THERE YOU KNOW
YEAH EXACTLY
AH YEAH YOU HAVE TO CHECK THAT WAY AHEAD OF TIME YOU KNOW
EVEN EVEN IF YOU HAVE TAKEN COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET COLLEGE CREDITS FOR THEM A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS WILL NOT ACCEPT THEM
YEAH YOU YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT BEFORE YOU EVEN APPLY TO THE SCHOOL YOU KNOW
OH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY I THINK WHAT ARE YOU STARTING TENTH GRADE TAKING THEM

SO WELL THE TOPIC IS UM
DO YOU THINK IT IS UM
PEOPLE SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG
I I DO NOT KNOW I DO NOT THINK THEY SHOULD THOUGH
I MEAN NOT THAT I WOULD DO IT BUT I MEAN THERE IS FREEDOM OF SPEECH
THAT IS WHAT I THINK I DO NOT KNOW IT IS JUST IT SEEMS A BIT HARSH I MEAN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
UM
EXPRESS YOURSELF
SO
RIGHT BUT I MEAN IT IS LIKE AH
PRO CHOICE AND PRO LIFE
I AM I AM
PRO LIFE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
BECAUSE I I JUST COULD NOT SEE DOING THAT BUT I AM PRO CHOICE BECAUSE I THINK EVERY
EVERY WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO CHOOSE SO
YEAH
WELL THAT IS TRUE I MEAN SO IF IF WE ARE A DEMOCRATIC
SOCIETY THEN THAT SHOULD
NOT THAT IT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED BUT BY ALL MEANS IF THAT IS HOW YOU
FEEL I MEAN
WHO AM I TO SAY RIGHT
ARE YOU ORIGINALLY FROM PHILADELPHIA
OH
SO YOU COMMUTE TO UM HOW LONG IS THE COMMUTE
THAT IS NEAT THOUGH A TROLLEY
OH YEAH THAT IS PRETTY BAD THOUGH
WE LIVE IN THE POCONOS
YEAH YEAH
UM THE CALL CENTRE IS IN THE LEHIGH VALLEY
LIKE RIGHT NEXT TO ALLENTOWN
SO IT IS ABOUT AH
FORTY MINUTE COMMUTE IT IS NOT TOO BAD
YEAH I ENJOY IT YEAH WE ARE ORIGINALLY FROM NEW YORK BUT UM
WE BOUGHT A HOME IN NEW JERSEY AND THEN WHEN WE WANTED TO GET A BIGGER HOUSE
EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE SO WE DECIDED TO LOOK IN THIS AREA WE GOT A LOT FOR OUR MONEY HERE SO WE ARE HAPPY HERE
WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING
OH OH SO THIS IS RIGHT IN YOUR LEAGUE THERE
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT YOUR CULTURE YEAH
YEAH CAN YOU GUESS WHERE I AM WELL I TOLD YOU I AM FROM NEW YORK BUT
NOBODY COULD EVER DECIPHER MY ACCENT
THEY ARE LIKE WHERE ARE YOU FROM I MEAN WHAT
I GUESS BECAUSE OF THE WAY I LOOK AND I SPEAK DIFFERENTLY I DO NOT KNOW
YOU KNOW CHOOSING THE RIGHT SCHOOL TO GO TO
WELL I AM I AM ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AGAIN BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY
UH I AM A MARKETING MAJOR YEAH
UM YEAH I AM TRYING TO GET MY G. P. A. RAISE THAT UP A LITTLE BIT BEFORE I TRANSFER TO MAKE SURE I CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP
YOU KNOW THAT IS DEFINITELY A FACTOR YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO WHEN YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE THAT YOU KNOW BIG DEBT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD HAVE TO TAKE OUT LOANS
CAUSE I
HMMM
WELL ACTUALLY WHAT I WOULD ADVISE MY CHILD TO DO IS TO LIKE FIRST OF ALL IS TO APPLY TO A LOT OF SCHOOLS NOT JUST ONE OR TWO
BECAUSE WHEN YOU APPLY TO MORE THAN ONE THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS YOU KNOW APPLY TO SOME CLOSE AT HOME SOME FAR AWAY SOME PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS SOME PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO VARY IT UP
YOU KNOW THAT WAY WHEN YOU YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET YOUR PACKAGES BACK AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT THE COLLEGES ARE OFFERING
YOU YOU HAVE MORE OF A CHOICE AND A SELECTION AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND SAY OKAY NO I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THIS ONE
UH YOU KNOW AND THAT WAY YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND HAVE SOME CHOICES AND OPTIONS
THAT IS JUST HMMM
YEAH
RIGHT BUT SEE THE
HMMM
YES
OH RIGHT YEAH I THINK HE SHOULD APPLY TO MANY DIFFERENT SCHOOLS BUT SEE THE THING IS WHAT DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHEN YOU ARE COMING RIGHT OUT OF THE TWELFTH GRADE YEAH YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE AN
ENGINEER BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU GET STUCK IN A SCHOOL THAT IS JUST FOR ENGINEERING AND YOU DECIDE THAT IS NOT FOR YOU THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME
YOU KNOW TRANSFERRING TO ANOTHER SCHOOL OR SWITCHING YOUR MAJOR AND THINGS LIKE THAT
HMMM
CORNELL HMMM
VIRGINIA TECH
OH OKAY
RIGHT HMMM
THAT ARE
HMMM
REALLY SEE
YEAH SEE THAT IS WHAT I MEAN IT IS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET UH STUCK IN SCHOOL IN A SCHOOL THAT ONLY SPECIALISES IN ONE THING
SO THAT WAY YOU CAN EASILY SWITCH MAJORS WITHOUT HAVING TO SWITCH SCHOOLS WHICH IS GOOD
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU ARE SWITCHING SCHOOLS YOU LOSE A LOT OF YOUR CREDITS
SOMETIMES
YEAH
YEAH UH_HUH
YEAH THEY SURE WILL NOT
HMMM
BUT UM AND LIKE ALSO WHEN YOU ARE APPLYING YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW I THINK I WOULD ADVISE MY CHILD TO AT LEAST TAKE THE S. A. T.'S TWO OR THREE TIMES
AND UH
I THINK IN THE TENTH GRADE YOU TAKE THE P. S. A. T.'S THE PREPARATORY S. A. T. TEST
AND THEN LIKE IN THE ELEVENTH GRADE THAT IS WHEN YOU WOULD TAKE THE ACTUAL S. A. T. AND TAKE IT TWO OR THREE TIMES
YEAH
UM I DO NOT THINK WELL SOME SCHOOLS ACTUALLY HAVE A MINIMUM IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENT ON YOUR S. A. T. SCORE THEY DO NOT EVEN ADMIT YOU
BECAUSE I KNOW N. Y. U. THE AH MINIMUM IS I THINK ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED
AND AH AND ALSO EVEN IF THEY DO NOT USE THAT AS CRITERIA TO GET INTO THEIR SCHOOL THEY DO USE THAT AS CRITERIA FOR AWARDING SCHOLARSHIPS
OKAY
YEAH
WELL MY MUSIC I LIKE UH ROCK MUSIC
AND COUNTRY WESTERN
AND THE BEST CONCERT UH I WENT TO UH SEE WAS UH
HAS TO BE ELTON JOHN

I I AM A LITTLE OLDER THAN THAT AND UH
I DO NOT USUALLY HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES ON THE COMPUTER
I AM ON THE INTERNET I AM DOING RESEARCH
OR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR AND THEN I GO BACK TO MY REGULAR LIFE
SO
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I DO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH COMPUTERS
I DO NOT EVEN ACTUALLY HAVE A COMPUTER IN MY HOME
I WANT TO BUY ONE BUT I FINANCIALLY DO NOT WANT TO JUST GET INTO THAT RIGHT NOW
DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT
OH REALLY
YOU KNOW WELL I KNOW I AM REALLY FRUGAL
IN THE WAY THAT WHEN THAT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH OVER A FORTY YEAR PERIOD
THE COMPUTER COSTS YOU TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
HAD YOU PAID FOR IT
UM AND THE ONLY REASON WHY IS I WAS LOOKING AT MY SISTER JUST BOUGHT A GATEWAY
WHICH I SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT HER HOUSE
AND SHE PROBABLY PAID THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HER COMPUTER
AND IT IS PHENOMENAL
IT IS THE NICEST SHE GOT AN EXTRA LARGE MONITOR
AND SHE HAS GOT LIKE ALL THE WONDERFUL SOUND SYSTEM
AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN GET WITH A COMPUTER
SHE GOT BASICALLY THE TOP OF THE LINE
AND HER SON SPENDS A LOT OF TIME PLAYING GAMES
BUT FOR HER AND IT IS WE GO ON THERE WE LOOK FOR STUFF
WE DO YOU KNOW PRICELINE DOT COM AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AND THEN WE CONTINUE WITH OUR HOUSEHOLD STUFF
AND THAT IS IT SO I WAS THINKING LIKE IF I WANTED TO GET A COMPUTER
YOU KNOW PAYING OVER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT NOW CAN NOT AFFORD IT DO NOT WANT TO DO IT
YEAH IT IS GREAT IT IS REALLY GOOD TO DO THAT BUT
RIGHT NOW DO NOT HAVE A COMPUTER
THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE THINGS I DO
I WOULD SAY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR I WILL PURCHASE A NEW COMPUTER
BUT I JUST RIGHT NOW I AM NOT FINANCIALLY FIXED TO DO THAT
THAT IS IT SO
HMMM
YEAH
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING I PLAYED ONE OF THOSE ONCE
WHEN I WAS IN UH
ATLANTIC CITY
THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ONE OF THE LITTLE UM
ARCADES DOWN THERE ON THE BOARD WALK
IT WAS AWFULLY EXPENSIVE BUT
IT WAS BASICALLY JUST YOUR HANDS
IT WAS NOT LIKE JOYSTICK ORIENTED BUT IT WAS YOUR HANDS
AND YOUR THE PRESSURE OF YOUR FEET MOVING YOU STOOD STILL YOU DID NOT LIKE WALK AROUND
EH AND IT IT WAS RUNNING AND KILLING
AND YEAH
YOU KNOW SO BASICALLY IT IS A VIOLENCE THING AGAIN
AND THAT IS REALLY SHAMEFUL
THAT YES IT IS TRUE
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO PLAY VIOLENT GAMES
I THINK THAT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE DOWNFALL OF SOCIETY AND CHILDREN AS WELL
UH WHAT KIND OF GAMES
I I GUESS YEAH GAMES AS FAR AS LIKE I DO NOT KNOW SEE THAT WOULD BE HARD

TOOK THIS JOB I WORKED IN BETHESDA
DOING BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

THERE I WORKED ON OUR AUCTION YOU KNOW WE
PARTICIPATED IN THE AUCTION IN THE SPRING
I WON A BUNCH OF LICENSES IT WAS UM
IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING ACTUALLY
NO IT IS NOT DRY IT IS
JUST UM
INTENSE
IT IS TOO INTENSE YOU KNOW
UM
YEAH YOU HAVE TO JUST REALLY
READ THE F. C. C. RULES
AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT AND IN FACT
THE LEGAL
PEOPLE THE PEOPLE IN OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT
DO NOT EVEN GET THAT INVOLVED IN IT
I MEAN BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW THOSE
I KNOW
BUT WE HAD AN OUTSIDE
FIRM WHO WAS INVOLVED
AND UM
BUT NOT IN THE DAY TO DAY RULES
BECAUSE REALLY YOU JUST HAVE
TO READ IT AND KNOW IT YOU KNOW
THEY HAVE LIKE A
A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION FOR YOU
THE F. C. C. DOES
SO THAT HELPS
BUT
ANYWAY
YEAH
EXACTLY THEY DO THEY DO NOT LIKE
THEY DO NOT LIKE MISHAPS
AND I GUESS THERE HAVE BEEN
MISINTERPRETATIONS OF
THE RULES IN THE PAST AND STUFF STUFF
UM SO
YEAH
YEAH
SO HOW ABOUT YOU WHAT DO YOU DO
UH_HUH
WHAT IS AN F. M. C.
OH
UH_HUH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
I I THINK THAT IS
I COULD NOT AGREE MORE
ACTUALLY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SAY
UM I LIVE IN NEW YORK
AND I KNOW THAT IF I HAD TO HOLD A MINIMUM WAGE
JOB I WOULD I WOULD DIE ON
ON FIVE TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR
YEAH BUT I THINK ALSO THAT UM
I MEAN IT IS
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT LEAST LIKE
EIGHT OR NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR HERE IN
NEW YORK BUT IN
YOU KNOW SAY
EH THE MIDWEST OR SOMEWHERE IT MIGHT
BE LESS
YOU KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT
DO OKAY ON LIKE
SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR
HAVE YOU
HAVE YOU HELD A MINIMUM WAGE
JOB OR
HAVE YOU EVER
DONE THAT
I DID ONLY WHEN I WAS IN
LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND
STUFF I DID BUT AND
EXACTLY
I WONDER IF
MAYBE IF A PERSON WAS
IS A STUDENT OR YOU KNOW IT IS LIKE
SOMEBODY IN HIGH SCHOOL OR
SOMETHING MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE
FOR A CERTAIN
I GUESS IT KIND OF DISCRIMINATES
THOUGH IF IT WERE A CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON
YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON YOUR
YOUR LIVING SITUATION IT WOULD
IT WOULD BE DISCRIMINATION
YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE GOTTEN THAT
QUESTION IT IS
IT IS NOT TOO HARD TO TALK ABOUT
COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF I HAVE HAD
TO TALK ABOUT
YEAH I GOT ONE TWICE
I GOT THE EMAIL ONE TWICE
UM BUT THIS IS
YEAH
HMMM I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THAT ONE YET
BUT I GUESS THAT TIME WILL COME IF I
KEEP MAKING MORE CALLS
OH
WELL THEY CERTAINLY PAY US
MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE
TO MAKE THESE CALLS SO
YEAH
WELL THAT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY MADE THIS
THE STANDARD
THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
BUT I COULD SEE I MEAN IT IS
IT IS SO HARD TO SAY BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHICH
JOB
YOU KNOW IF
IF YOU ARE DOING A CERTAIN KIND OF JOB YOU
SAY OKAY WELL THAT KIND OF JOB IS REALLY ONLY WORTH
SO MUCH PER HOUR SO
YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET AWAY WITH
PAYING MINIMUM WAGE FOR JOBS THAT END UP
BEING WORTH A LOT MORE
MONEY FOR THE TIME PUT IN
I WONDER IF THERE ARE
YOU KNOW HOW COULD THERE BE STANDARDS THAT
THAT SAY WHAT KIND OF JOB YOU HAVE
GOT AND WHAT KIND THEY HAVE
TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE AND WHAT KIND YOU HAVE TO PAY MORE
HMMM
WHAT
YEAH
EXACTLY THERE IS A LOT OF
STRESS INVOLVED AND
THERE IS
UH THERE IS AN ASPECT
OF IT THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO STUFF
EXACTLY RIGHT
YOU TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF THAT
THEY MIGHT SAY WELL THAT IS A NO BRAIN
JOB AND YOU KNOW YOU BETTER
ONLY PAY MINIMUM WAGE BUT
IF YOU HAVE TO LIKE
MAKE STUFF TO ORDER I WOULD
SAY THAT COULD BE KIND OF
A PAIN IN THE NECK
DEPENDING ON WHERE
WHERE YOU ARE
SOME PEOPLE ARE PRETTY PICKY
I KNOW FAST FOOD IN NEW YORK
IS IS CRAZY
WHERE DO YOU LIVE
I WOULD RATHER BE IN PHILLY
MYSELF
NO ACTUALLY I AM A CUSTOMER
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO WORKS
FOR OMNIPOINT AND PASSED ALONG THE
THE SURVEY THING
YEAH AND IT I MEAN IT IS KIND OF
FUN WHEN YOU KNOW THEY
JUST GIVE YOU A TOPIC AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE
TO MAKE THIS CONVERSATION WITH A
PERSON YOU DO NOT KNOW AT ALL IT IS KIND OF FUN
BUT I ACTUALLY GOT HOOKED UP
ONE TIME WITH A PERSON WHO
WHO GAVE ME THE
TOLD ME TO SIGN UP FOR THIS
SURVEY AND I ACTUALLY GOT HOOKED UP
WITH HIM ONCE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN LIKE I RECOGNISE
THIS VOICE IT WAS FUNNY
YEAH
BUT IT CAN BE HARD TO TALK ABOUT
THE WHOLE THE SUBJECT
FOR A WHOLE FIVE OR SIX MINUTES
I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE THAT DIFFICULT
BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN BE
I GUESS IF YOU HAVE
YEAH
SEVENTH OR EIGHTH
WHAT WAS THAT
OH OKAY

HMMM
UH
YES AND NO
I KNOW I AM TRYING TO THINK WHAT I MEAN I GUESS
NO I GUESS THE PERSON ACTUALLY
DID HIT THE PEDESTRIAN
AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY WERE BEING SUED FOR IT
SO THE LAWYER WOULD ASK YOU
SO WAS HE DRIVING SAFELY AND YOU
YEAH HE WAS AND ACTUALITY HE WAS NOT
UH
UH YEAH THAT IS TRUE OKAY
YEAH YEAH I GUESS YEAH
YEAH I GUESS SO YEAH
IT DOES BUT I AM JUST LIKE
YES YES AND NO THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW
IF IT IS JUST SOMETHING
HMMM NO
UH AW THAT NOW SEE THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT YEAH THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I MEAN
THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS MY CHILD
BUT IF IT IS ME YEAH LIKE YOU SAID JOKING AROUND YEAH
BUT
YEAH NOW IF YOU WERE NOT REALLY HURT NO
YEAH
NOW THAT IS
WOW THAT OH
YEAH IT DOES IT REALLY DOES UH
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS
YEAH
NOW WHAT IF IT WAS
I AM TRYING TO THINK
ANOTHER TYPE OF PERJURY THOUGH
LIKE NOT JUST THAT
THE CAR
INCIDENT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING
HMMM I AM TRYING TO THINK OF A
BUT YEAH LIKE YOU SAID IT DOES
THAT DOES CHANGE THINGS ONCE ONCE YOU START CHANGING
THE WHOLE SCENARIO
IT STARTS TO
CHANGE WOW
HMMM
REALLY
MAKE YOU REALLY USE YOUR BRAIN I TELL YOU
HMMM
TRYING TO
NO NO IT WOULD NOT NO BUT I MEAN NO NOT REALLY
BECAUSE THEN BUT THEN I WONDER HOW HOW WOULD IT GO DOWN AS FAR AS OKAY SAY FOR INSTANCE THEY WERE PLAYING UM
YOU KNOW WERE HIT YOU FELL BUT YOU WERE NOT ACTUALLY
LIKE YOU SAID SEVERELY HURT AND THEN SOMEONE
END UP CALLING YOU KNOW NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE THEY SAW THE INCIDENT AND THEN THE COPS CAME I WONDER HOW FAR
WOULD IT GO
THERE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WOW
HMMM
BUT THEN I WONDER IF
OKAY SAY
THE COP UM THE POLICE OFFICER ASKS YOU WELL DO YOU WANT TO PRESS CHARGES
AND IF THE PERSON SAYS
YEAH YOU KNOW YES I DO BECAUSE
YOU KNOW
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION THEN
I I JUST WONDER HOW LONG THEY WOULD
THEY WOULD
I MEAN
BUT WHAT KIND OF
WHAT KIND OF CHARGE WOULD THAT BE I MEAN
HOW LONG
HOW LONG WOULD THE THAT SENTENCE ACTUALLY BE THOUGH
BUT THEN
BECAUSE IF YOU PRESS CHARGES YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE TO
WOW THIS IS DEEP
HMMM
TRYING TO
NOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO OKAY YOU PRESS
DO YOU WANT TO PRESS CHARGES YEAH BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LAWYER AND ALL
AH WHO FEEL LIKE DOING ALL THAT AND THEN
YEAH NOWADAYS YEAH THAT IS TRUE
THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
I WONDER IF THEY ACTUALLY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I WONDER IF THEY ACTUALLY GIVE THEM A UM
IF THEY FINE THEM
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE
BETTER YEAH THAT WOULD BE
MORE REASONABLE THAN ACTUALLY SENDING SOMEONE
TO JAIL LIKE YOU SAID NOT UNLESS THE THE UM SCENERY ACTUALLY CHANGES AND SOMEONE IS
SEVERELY HURT OR THEY ARE PARALYSED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE
BECAUSE OF SOMEONE JOKING AROUND THEN THAT IS A DIFFERENT
WHAT'S THE SENSE OF IT I MIGHT AS WELL JUST FLIP BURGERS FOR THE FOR THE FIVE TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR AND
JUST TAKE IT EASY
YEAH
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE PEOPLE WANT TO EVEN WORK
FOR THAT FIVE TWENTY FIVE EITHER THEY'RE JUST EXPECTING IT
HMMM
HMMM
OH
UH
THEY ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT THE VARIATION BETWEEN STATE TO STATE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE TOO THAT
UH IF SOME PLACES WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS HIGHER THAT
THE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN OTHER PLACES BUT
UM
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE
THERE AREN'T THAT AREN'T THAT MANY PLACES THAT OUR STANDARD OF LIVING IS LIKE HIGHER THAN OTHERS THAT I KNOW OF
I MEAN EXCEPT LIKE MAYBE LIKE IN NEW YORK CITY OR
UM
I DON'T KNOW
I I WOULD SAY YES
YOU KNOW JOKING AROUND AND YOU HIT SOMEBODY
HMMM
WELL IT SAID THAT THEY THEY FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS JOKING AROUND
IN THE CAR HE WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT HE WAS DOING
HMMM
WHAT IF IT WONDER IF IT WERE YOU WALKING ALONG THE STREET AND SOMEBODY WAS JOKING AROUND THEY WERE NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND HIT YOU
WOULD DO YOU FEEL THEY NEED TO GO TO JAIL
WONDER IF THEY HIT YOU WONDER IF THEY HIT YOUR CHILD IF YOU HAD A CHILD
HMMM
WONDER IF YOU WERE LIKE REALLY IN REALLY REALLY HURT
YOU KNOW
PARALYSED AND
YOU ARE PARALYSED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS JOKING AROUND IN THE CAR
HMMM SEE IT STARTS CHANGING
YOU KNOW
WELL IT YOU KNOW SO WOULD IT WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT WHAT IF YOU WERE A YOU KNOW A
ON THE JURY AND DEPENDING ON WHAT THE SITUATION WAS I GUESS
I GUESS DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION HOW SEVERE IT WOULD BE
IS WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION
SO WHAT YOU KNOW
I GUESS IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE GOING TO COURT IF IT WERE NOT SERIOUS
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
HMMM IT THE SAME AS ANYWHERE ELSE
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON IF YOU GO AND SUE THE PERSON
YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY ARE SAYING WELL
I WAS DRIVING CAREFULLY YOU HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE DRIVING CAREFULLY
AND HIT SOMEBODY
AND THEN THE FACT THAT THEY LIED
THEY LIED AND SAID THEY WERE DRIVING SAFE AND THEN YOU FOUND OUT THEY WERE JOKING AROUND

ON THE SITUATION I MEAN ON SOMEONE HITTING A PEDESTRIAN I MEAN THAT IS LIKE
THAT IS A HUGE CHARGE BUT
I MEAN IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT THEY GOT CHARGED WITH AND WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING I COULD NOT SAY
IF I IF I WOULD STRAIGHT OUT LIE I REALLY DO NOT THINK I WOULD BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
I DO NOT THINK I WOULD STRAIGHT OUT LIE BUT I MAY
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS UM
YOU KNOW A LITTLE SIMPLER THAN IT WAS
WITHOUT LYING

THEN OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
YOU COULD HAVE UM
OR A FAT BUSTER
YOU KNOW DIET CLUB
THAT AND YOU HAVE ONE
WHERE THEY GOT
UH RECENTLY GOT A A
SENT OUT FOR ALL THIS INFORMATION
AND
THIS ONE WOULD HAVE ABOUT
NATURAL PRODUCTS
TO WHERE ALL RIGHT IF YOU
USE ANY
SOAP
DEODORANT MOUTHWASH IT ALL SUPPOSED TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF CHEMICAL IN IT
THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IRRITATING
TO YOU DOWN THE LINE
AND WHAT THE WHOLE
THING IS JUST LIKE HOW IT IS
WITH THE CIGARETTES
THEY SAY YOU GOT CERTAIN
PRODUCTS THAT YOU USE EVERYDAY
LIKE UH SHAMPOO FOR INSTANCE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
DEGREASERS IN IT JUST LIKE
THEY USE ON CAR ENGINES
UH_HUH YEAH
I GOT ALL THE INFORMATION
AND THIS IS ONE COMPANY
GOT A LINE OF PRODUCTS
TO WHERE THEY SAY
IS ALL NATURAL STUFF
IN THEIR INGREDIENTS THERE IS NOTHING HARMFUL
AND THAT IS
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MAKEUP LINE YOU KNOW THEY GOT A
VARIETY OF STUFF
AND SO WHAT I AM DOING I AM SETTING UP LOOKING AT THAT
I AM LOOKING AT THAT THING IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
I AM LOOKING AT
SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT A COMBINATION MAYBE
THREE THINGS

IS MAYBE BY MARCH
IT IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS I JUST
TOLD YOU ABOUT THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES
