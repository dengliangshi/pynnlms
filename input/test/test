HUNDRED AND SOMETHING LIKE AND I DID NOT EVEN MAKE A PAYMENT THAT WAS ALL PRICE ADJUSTMENTS THIS IS THE NICE WAY TO SHOP
THEN I HAD TO STAND IN LINE

AND I DID NOT DO WELL I WAS
YOU KNOW I AM A PRETTY BRIGHT PERSON BUT
YEAH
I DO NOT KNOW THESE KIDS TODAY UM A LOT OF THEM I DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY DO SO WELL
